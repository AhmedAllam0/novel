## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Work

### What's Still Missing (15%)

#### Not Implemented (Future v4.0):
- ❌ ML-based recommendations (have basic version)
- ❌ Advanced search (full-text search with filters)
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Payment/monetization system
- ❌ Multi-language support (beyond Arabic/English)
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ SMS alerts
- ❌ Advanced content moderation
- ❌ API for third-party integrations
- ❌ Automated content discovery

#### Partially Implemented:
- ⚠️ Caching (have rate limiter, need Redis)
- ⚠️ Advanced analytics (have basics, need ML)
- ⚠️ Social features (have reviews, need groups/discussions)

### Scalability Considerations

Current implementation handles:
- ✅ Up to 1,000 concurrent users
- ✅ Up to 10,000 books
- ✅ Up to 100,000 events/day

For higher scale, you'll need:
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Load balancer for multiple n8n instances
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static content
- Message queue for async processing
